<h1><b>Vehicle</b></h1>

<p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup style= "color: blue;">1</sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons,<br>
bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships,<br>
boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and<br>
spacecraft.<sup style = "color: blue;">[2]</sup></p>

<p>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:<br> 
wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for<br> 
road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup style="color: blue;"> [3]</p>
